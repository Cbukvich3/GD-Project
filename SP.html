	<p>This piece was created by Daniel and I while figuring out how to utilize the program Adobe Illustrator. This is a special piece as we created this not knowing how cool it could be used in projects. It sparks creativity and can be used as many other things. A Black hole was the first thing we thought of, what do you think of it. Let us know <a href="CI.html">here</a> </p>
